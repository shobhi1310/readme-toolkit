# readme-toolkit
The readme-toolkit is a Python repository for generating a readme of a repository.

## Description
There is always a tension among the users for writing a flawless readme and it is also very cumbersome to do the documentation in the last moment. This repository has also been made using the this toolkit itself.

 The project has been prepared keeping in mind these use cases:

1. For people who are new to `readme.md`
2. For people who write in the last moment
3. People with less vocabulary

 The highlights of the repositories are:

1. AST is used for finding out the most frequently used custom function
2. Dependency is listed for some supported languages (javascript as of now)
3. Neat framing of readme is provided as an output
## Installation
1. for cloning the repository
	```
	git clone https://github.com/tapish2000/readme-toolkit.git
	```
2. 	```
	cd readme-toolkit
	```

## Usage
1. Have `beautiful-soup` and `request` installed in your system using `pip`
2. In the executing directory, type this command for invoking the interactive CLI.
	```
	make
	```
## Output
- output_readme.md
- dependency.txt
- data.json

As of now the meta-data is not linked into the output readme and will be integrated in release 2.0, though they are collected and stored.
